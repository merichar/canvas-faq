  <h1>Unofficial CMU Canvas FAQ
  <small>
    Too much snark to be official.
  </small>
  </h1>
  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>
    Didja read the big title up there? It's an unofficial (TM) Canvas
    FAQ for <a href="http://www.cmu.edu" title="Carnegie Mellon
    University" alt="CMU">CMU</a> people. If you are not a CMU person
    this is unlikely to help you. You can hit the back button
    now. It's fine. We won't take it personally.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why unofficial? Because now you can't complain. It's not an
    official resource, it's just a little bonus information with a
    side of folksy charm. By reading on, you agree not to complain
    about how unprofessional it is. We're blowing off a little steam
    and making something useful while doing it. If you would like
    documentation that kisses your forehead as you read it, head over
    to the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/canvas" title="CMU Canvas
    Documentation" alt="CMU Canvas Documentation">Official CMU Canvas
    Documentation</a>.

  <h2>The FAQ</h2>
  <ol>
    <li id="not-blackboard">
      <h3>Why doesn't [thing] work exactly like Blackboard did?</h3>
      <p>
        Shockingly enough, because this *isn't* Blackboard. We totally
        get it: You want to focus on the things that matter to you and
        not learn a new tool; it's not like you have an ocean of free
        time. We didn't decide to switch on a whim; we didn't decide
        to switch in a vacuum: We spent a year in pilot with courses
        in every school and worked with representatives from faculty
        senate, student government, etc. At the end of the day, it was
        clear that Blackboard was holding us back, and familiarity was
        not enough of a reason to stay. So it will be one inconvenient
        semester to transition and then you're good for another 10
        years.

        While we're here under this question, let's go ahead and take
        a minute to remind ourselves that we are not designers (Actual
        professional designers please disregard). Say it aloud: "I am
        not a designer" (Actual professional designers please
        disregard once more). Now, if your comment was about to be
        something along the lines of "That was a stupid place for
        [thing]" or "That's a stupid color for [thing]", please
        consider two things: 1. Is it justifiably stupid, or are you
        just familiar with something else? 2. If something is legit
        stupid, the good news is Canvas is an open source project. You
        can go fix the thing you hate and contribute it back to
        Canvas.

    <li id="students-disappear">
      <h3>Why do my students disappear??</h3>
      <p>
        So, you manually added some students to your course and like
        clockwork they get kicked out. Here's the deal: This will only
        happen when you add students to sections that are synced to
        SIS. How can you tell which sections are synced? Go to your
        course settings. Click on the Sections tab. Anything with a
        SIS ID is going to be synced to SIS. Zealously. But a student
        walked up to you with those big puppy eyes and asked to be
        allowed into the class. It's too cute to resist. We
        understand. Have some options:
      </p>

      <p>
        First option: Add them to ANY non-SIS section. You can even
        make a new section! A section named "Waitlist", a section
        named "Just Friends", a section named "Where Are We Going And
        Why Am I In This Handbasket?"... Sections for everybody!
        Second option: Enroll them in a SIS section, but give them any
        role that is NOT "Student". Anyone who has added TAs to
        specific sections and realized that *they're* not getting
        kicked out may have just experienced an epiphany: We only sync
        the "Student" role, and ignore everything else. Third option:
        Have your puppy-eyed student go fill out
        a <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registration/docs/course-audit.pdf"
        title="Course Audit Form PDF" alt="Course Audit Form
        PDF">Course Audit Form (PDF)</a>, which has the added bonus of
        letting the registrar know your class is so popular students
        show up and do work even if they're not getting credit!
        Official audit students get synced, too. Fourth option:
        Actually register them (We know, so novel).
      </p>

      <p>
        "What were you thinking? This doesn't work the way Blackboard
        did!" You're right, but it solves a lot of problems: 1. Less
        roster ambiguity: Manually adding a student to Blackboard that
        should be registered in SIS is misleading. A student could
        make it to the end of the semester believing they were squared
        away with the registrar... right up until the final grade
        deadline passes and a bundle of panic is at your door. A
        separate role or a separate section makes it clear that
        something special is going on. 2. Less cruft. Let's say you've
        registered a student in SIS, but don't want to wait for the
        next enrollments update. Go ahead and add the student with the
        Student role to the SIS section they will be in; the
        enrollment update process will see the student is enrolled as
        they should be and move along. The difference is that they
        will be automatically managed going forward: If they drop the
        class, your Canvas roster will reflect that instead of having
        the enrollment sit around like a zombie in Blackboard waiting
        for a manual purge. If that doesn't appeal to you, take pity
        on the intro instructor with a huge lecture section.
